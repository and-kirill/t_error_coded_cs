# Coded compressed sensing
This is a simulation software to reproduce the results of K. Andreev, P. Rybin and A. Frolov, "Coded Compressed Sensing With List Recoverable Codes for the Unsourced Random Access," in IEEE Transactions on Communications, vol. 70, no. 12, pp. 7886-7898, Dec. 2022, doi: 10.1109/TCOMM.2022.3216901.

# Simulation results
## Fading channel

For the fading channel, we assume the maximum tolerable missed detection probability as 0.1, and maximum false alarm rate as 0.001

## AWGN channel
For the AWGN channel, we assume the maximum tolerable missed detection probability as 0.05, and maximum false alarm rate as 0.05
